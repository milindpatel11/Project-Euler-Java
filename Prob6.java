// PROBLEM DESCR

// The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is == 385
// The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is == 3025
// Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is
// 3025  âˆ’ 385 = 2640 .
// Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
